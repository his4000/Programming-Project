# Elevator Simulation
Project #2 for the programming project class in 2016 Spring at Konkuk University, Seoul.

## Purpose

Implement the elevator algorithm.

## Details

- The building has 10th floor and 3 elevators. The elevators operate relatively.
- The operations has to be automated except the button input.
    * Set a target floor randomly when push the button at the specific floor.
- Elevator can move 1 floor per 1 second.
- Show the target floor.
- Show the current direction.
- Only for 1 person elevator

## Display

- View of the whole elevator

## Functions

- Push the up and down buttons at specific floor.
